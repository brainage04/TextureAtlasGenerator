# Create a new release

1. Update `mod_version` in `gradle.properties`.
2. Commit that change.
3. Push that commit.
4. Create a matching annotated git tag in the form `vX.Y.Z` so the tag message becomes the GitHub release notes.
5. For a short release note, run `git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Summarise the release here"`.
6. For longer release notes, put them in a file and run `git tag -a v1.0.1 -F RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
7. Push the tag with `git push origin v1.0.1`.

The release workflow reads the annotated tag message and uses it as the GitHub release body.
If the tag has no annotation text, GitHub auto-generated release notes are used as a fallback.
GitHub Actions checks out tag pushes in a way that can obscure annotated tag contents, so the workflow fetches the remote tag object before reading the notes.

The FabricModdingConventions reusable release workflow builds both loader JARs and attaches the Fabric and NeoForge artifacts to the GitHub Release.
If `MODRINTH_TOKEN` is configured, the same workflow publishes both loader JARs and the release notes to Modrinth. CurseForge publishing is turned off (`publish_curseforge: false`).
All destinations use the same tag notes. A missing `MODRINTH_TOKEN` skips only Modrinth; the GitHub Release still proceeds.
